Background
==========

- Set all FDs to 0 apart from one FD which is set to 1
- Track the value added per country sector
- generate an SCxSC matrix of value added sources per country-sector.

Analysis
========

- Use this matrix to generate a country-intertwinedness measure. Where does a particular country's value added originate from?
- Could track this intertwinedness measure over time to see which countries are moving together and which are moving apart.
